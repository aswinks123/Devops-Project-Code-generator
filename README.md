ABSTRACT

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a development approach that helps streamline the software development process by automating various stages of the software development lifecycle. More than that, the primary aim of this project is to create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for a QR code generator and scanner application. The application will be developed using Python and deployed in Docker containers, which are managed using Docker Swarm. The project uses a variety of DevOps tools such as Azure, and AWS for building virtual machines, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Ansible for automation, Nagios for monitoring, and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery. We will use Terraform to create the required infrastructure in Azure including the resources like virtual networks, subnets, security groups, and virtual machines
